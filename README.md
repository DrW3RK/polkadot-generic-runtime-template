# OpenZeppelin Runtime Template for Polkadot

[Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) has a steep learning curve. In order to make it easier for newcomers to get started, OpenZeppelin is providing runtime templates that can be used to quickly bootstrap a [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate) project using Polkadot SDK.

Along with the templates, OpenZeppelin also provides a [documentation website](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/substrate-runtimes/1.0.0/) that explains the templates and the niche details.
